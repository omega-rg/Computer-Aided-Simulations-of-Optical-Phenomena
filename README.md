# Computer Aided Simulations of Optical Phenomena

## Our Work
In this project, we simulated optical phenomena on a computer using `OpenCV` library in Python. We performed the same experiments in a lab and compared the experimental results with the results obtained from the simulation. The following phenomena were simulated:
 * **Single Slit Diffraction** `interference.py`
 * **Snellâ€™s Law** `snelllaw.py`
 
## Usage Details
To run the simulations, follow the following steps,
1. Download the entire contents of the repository 
2. Install `OpenCV` library in your Python environment
3. Run the desired `.py` file
